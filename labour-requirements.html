        <p>You must make an annual election for the installation tax year to meet the labour requirements in order to claim the higher rate for the eligible clean economy investment tax credit (ITC) you have selected to apply for.</p>
	      <p>If you do <strong>not</strong> make an annual election to meet the labour requirements, you can claim the ITC you have selected at a credit rate reduced by 10%. </p>
	      <p>The 2 main aspects to the labour requirements are <strong>prevailing wage requirements</strong> and <strong>apprenticeship requirements</strong>.</p>

     <h2 id="prewage">Prevailing wage requirements</h2>
<p>Generally, the prevailing wage requirements are met by paying <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="Y" href="#Y">covered <span class="nowrap">workers<span class="mrgn-lft-sm far fa-question-circle"></span></span></a> in accordance with an eligible collective agreement.</p>
<p>If covered workers are <strong>not</strong> subject to an eligible collective agreement, the prevailing wage requirements are generally met as long as the covered workers are paid in an amount at least equal to the amount of wages (without taking into account overtime), benefits and pension contributions specified in an <strong>eligible collective agreement</strong>, that most closely aligns to the worker’s experience level, type of work, and location in which such work is performed.</p>
<p>The claimant <strong>must</strong> attest that it has:</p>
	      <ul class="fa-ul">
		      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>met the prevailing wage requirement for its own employees who are covered workers</li>
		      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>taken reasonable steps to ensure that any covered workers employed by any other person or partnership at the designated work site are compensated in accordance with the prevailing wage</li>
	      </ul>
<details>
	<summary id="eligible">Eligible collective agreement</summary>
<p>An eligible collective agreement is defined as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A project labour agreement</li>
		<li>A prescribed agreement</li>
		<li>The most recent multi-employer collective bargaining agreement negotiated with a trade union that is an affiliate of Canada’s Building Trades Unions (CBTU) for a given trade in a region or province</li>
		
	</ul>
	
<p>The most recent collective agreements can be accessed through sources such as the CBTU or Trade unions affiliated with the CBTU:</p>

</details>
</details>
	         <h3>Communicating to employees</h3>
	      <p>An employer <strong>must</strong> communicate to employees that the designated work site is subject to prevailing wage requirements in relation to covered workers. They also need to provide information to employees regarding how to report failures to pay prevailing wages to the Minister of National Revenue (Minister) using the CRA informant line <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/suspected-tax-cheating-in-canada-overview.html">Suspected Tax Cheating in Canada</a>.</p>
<p>An employer must communicate this information and what it means for covered workers:</p>
	      <ul class="fa-ul">
		      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>Through a poster, notice, or by electronic means</li>
 <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>In a manner that is readily visible</li> 
		       <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>In a manner that is accessible</li>
		       <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>In a plain language format</li>
	      </ul>
	      
	      <h3>Factors to consider</h3>
<p>There are various factors to consider when determining if labour requirements for prevailing wage requirements have been met. The following list is non-exhaustive, and only meant to provide general guidance for potential ITC claimants.</p>
	      <p>Consider:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>How the wages were calculated for covered workers</li>
		      <li>What value was placed on determining the benefits calculated and paid to covered workers (benefits such as vacation, pension, health and welfare)</li>
		      <li>Documentation of the efforts made to obtain <a href="#eligible">eligible collective agreements</a></li>
		      
		      <ul><li>List the eligible collective agreement(s) that were obtained</li></ul>
		         <ul><li>List the eligible collective agreement(s) that were used to determine compensation at least equal to the amount of wages and benefits specified in the eligible agreement that most closely aligns to the worker’s experience level, tasks and location</li></ul>
		         <ul><li>Provide reasoning as to why certain collective agreements were not used</li></ul>
		         <ul><li>Provide documentation of the efforts to obtain applicable collective agreements</li></ul>
		      
		        <li>The eligible collective agreement that was used was not expired</li>
		      <ul><li>If it was expired, the amounts of wages and benefits stipulated in the agreement must be adjusted by the average Consumer Price Index for each calendar year that begins after the expiration</li></ul> 
		 
		       <li>The efforts made to ensure sub contractors were aware of the labour requirements</li>
		      <li>The efforts made to ensure sub contractors conveyed the labour requirements to any sub-sub contractors</li>


		      
		             <li>The project labour agreement that covers the work associated with the investments eligible for the specified tax credits was signed </li>
		      <li>How information was communicated to covered workers </li>
	      </ul>



	      
	          <p>To learn more, review: <a href=""><mark>Subsection 127.46 (3), Prevailing wage requirements</a></mark></p>

	  
	      
        <h2 id="apprentice">Apprenticeship requirements</h2>    
<p>Generally, the apprenticeship requirement is met by making <a href="#effort">reasonable efforts</a> to ensure that at least 10% of the labour performed by workers in the Red Seal trades is performed by registered apprentices at a designated work site. </p>
<p>Red Seal trade means, for a province using the Red Seal Program for a particular trade, the relevant Red Seal trade managed by the Canadian Council of Directors of Apprenticeship and, in any other case, an equivalent provincially registered trade.</p>
	      <p>This would be subject to the restriction that at no point could there be more apprentices working than are allowed under applicable labour laws or a collective agreement that applies to the work being performed.</p>
	      <p>The claimant <strong>must</strong> attest that it has:</p>
	      <ul class="fa-ul">
		      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>met the apprenticeship requirements that at least 10% of the total hours that are worked during the installation taxation year are by Red Seal workers</li>
     <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>ensured that work is at a designated work site of the incentive claimant on the preparation or installation of specified property</li>
	      </ul>

	      

  <h3>Factors to consider</h3>
<p>There are various factors to consider when determining if labour requirements for apprenticeship have been met. The following list is non-exhaustive, and is only meant to provide general guidance for potential ITC claimants.</p>
	      <p>Consider:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>The calculation made to confirm that at least 10% of the labour performed by Red Seal trades is performed by apprentices</li>
		      <li>The <a href="#effort">reasonable efforts</a> made to ensure the minimum target of 10% was achieved </li>
		      <li>If projects were under construction prior to the coming into force date, that a review was made to verify requirements were met as of the coming into force date </li>
	      </ul>
	       <h3 id="effort">Reasonable efforts</h3>
	      <p>For the purposes of apprenticeship requirements, an incentive claimant will be deemed to have satisfied the reasonable efforts if certain conditions are met. These include:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>At least every 4 months:</li>
		       <ul> <li>the incentive claimant posts a bona fide job advertisement, seeking sufficient apprentices to perform those hours of labour.

   <h2 id="compliance">Consequences of non-compliance</h2>
        <p>There are consequences for not complying with the labour requirements when the claimant has attested and elected into those requirements, and claimed the higher credit. </p>
	      <p>These may include:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>A penalty for prevailing wages not compensated </li>
		      <ul><li>$20 per day for each day in the taxation year, for each covered worker that was not paid the prevailing wage</li></ul>
		      <li>A corrective measure in the form of a top-up amount paid to each covered worker for the amount of the prevailing wage not paid as per notification from the Minister</li>
		      <ul><li>A penalty paid to the Minister of 120% of the top-up amount determined for each worker that was not paid the top-up amount </li></ul>
		      <li>A penalty for apprenticeship hours not met</li>
		      <ul><li>$50 multiplied by the difference between the hours of labour that were required to be performed by apprentices of Red Seal trades, and the hours of labour that were actually performed by apprentices </li></ul>
	      </ul>
<p>Where failure to meet any of the labour requirements is done knowingly or in circumstances amounting in gross negligence, the claimant is:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>disentitled to the regular tax credit rate and is entitled only to the reduced tax credit rate </li>
		        <li>liable to pay a penalty equal to 50% of the difference between the amount of the specified tax credit claimed and the amount that the incentive claimant would have been entitled to under the reduced rate</li>
	      </ul>

 <h2 id="apply">When the labour requirements apply</h2>

	      <p>Labour Requirements apply in respect to specified property prepared or installed on or after November 28, 2023.</p>
