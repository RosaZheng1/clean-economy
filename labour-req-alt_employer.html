	      <p>The 2 main aspects of the labour requirements are <strong>prevailing wage requirements</strong> and the <strong>apprenticeship requirements</strong>.</p>     
          <p>You must elect to meet certain labour requirements for prevailing wages and apprenticeship standards to benefit from the regular credit rate of the eligible clean economy ITCs. </p>

       <h2 id="apply">When the labour requirements apply</h2>

	      <p>Labour requirements apply in respect of specified property prepared or installed after November 27, 2023.</p>
	
	<p>The labour requirements <strong>do not</strong> apply to a clean economy ITC claimed for the acquisition of off-road zero-emission vehicles, or the acquisition and installation of low-carbon heat equipment.</p>

	      <p>To be able to <strong>claim the regular rate</strong> for each eligible clean economy ITC you have selected to apply for, you <strong>must</strong>, for each <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="M" href="#M">installation <span class="nowrap"> tax year<span class="mrgn-lft-sm far fa-question-circle"></span></span></a>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Elect to meet the labour requirements</li>
	<li>Attest that you have met the labour requirements</li>
</ul>




	      
	         <p>If you <strong>do not</strong> elect to meet the labour requirements, you can claim the ITC you have selected at a reduced credit rate of 10 percentage points less than the regular rate. </p>
	   <p>For example if the regular credit rate is 30%, the reduced rate is 20%.</p>

<p>If you have elected to meet the labour requirements, you must comply with and attest to meeting them in order to claim the ITC you have applied for at the regular rate.</p>

	<h3>Meeting prevailing wage requirements</h3>
	<p>Prevailing wage requirements are met by compensating <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="Y" href="#Y">covered <span class="nowrap">workers<span class="mrgn-lft-sm far fa-question-circle"></span></span></a> at the <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="P" href="#P">designated <span class="nowrap"> work site<span class="mrgn-lft-sm far fa-question-circle"></span></span></a>, in respect of their work on the preparation or installation of <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="J" href="#J">specified <span class="nowrap">property<span class="mrgn-lft-sm far fa-question-circle"></span></span></a>, in accordance with an <a href="#eligible">eligible collective agreement</a> that applies to the workers.</p>
<p>If covered workers are <strong>not</strong> subject to an eligible collective agreement, the prevailing wage requirements are generally met as long as the covered workers are compensated in an amount that: </p>
	
	<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-and cnjnctn-sm">
<li class="cnjnctn-col">
<p>Most closely aligns to the worker’s experience level, type of work, and location in which such work is performed </p>	
</li>		      
<li class="cnjnctn-col">
<p>Is at least equal to the amount of wages (without taking into account overtime) and benefits (including vacation, pension, health and welfare benefits) required to be provided for employees under an eligible collective agreement</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
	
<details>
	<summary id="eligible">What an eligible collective agreement is</summary>
<p>For provinces and territories (other than Quebec), an eligible collective agreement is defined as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The most recent multi-employer collective bargaining agreement negotiated with a trade union that is an affiliate of Canada’s Building Trades Unions (CBTU) for a given trade in a region or province</li>
		
		<li>A project labour agreement established with a trade union that provides wages and benefits for covered workers in a given trade that are at least equal to the regular wage (without taking into account overtime) and benefits provided for covered workers in the most recent multi-employer collective bargaining agreement</li>
		
	
	</ul>
	<br>
<p>The most recent collective agreements can be accessed through sources such as the CBTU or the following trade unions that are affiliates of the CBTU:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and Allied workers (IAHFIAW)</li>
			<li>International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers</li>
			<li>Operative Plasterer’s and Cement Masons’ International Association of the United States And Canada (OPCMIA)</li>
		<li>International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW)</li>

		<h3>Complying with prevailing wage requirements</h3>
		<p>You must communicate to employees that the designated work site is subject to prevailing wage requirements in relation to covered workers.</p>
<p>This information must be communicated:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Through a poster, notice, or by electronic means</li>
		<li>In a manner that is readily visible</li>
		<li>In a manner that is accessible</li>
		<li>In a plain language format</li>
	</ul>
<br>
<p>You must also provide information to employees regarding how to report failures to pay prevailing wages to the CRA.</p>


	
	</li>
<li>
		<h3>Determining if prevailing wage requirements were met</h3>
		<p>There are various factors to consider when determining if labour requirements for prevailing wages have been met. </p>
	      
	
	
	<details>
		      <summary>Factors to consider for prevailing wage requirements</summary>
 <p>The following list is non-exhaustive, and only meant to provide general guidance for potential ITC claimants.</p>
		      <p>Consider:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>How the wages were calculated for covered workers</li>
		      <li>What value was placed in determining the benefits calculated and paid to covered workers (benefits such as vacation, pension, health and welfare)</li>
		     
		      
		      <li>What <a href="#eligible">eligible collective agreement</a> was used and why</li>
		      
		      <ul><li>The name(s) of the eligible collective agreement(s) that were obtained</li></ul>
		         <ul><li>List the eligible collective agreement(s) that were used to determine compensation, including wages and benefits </li></ul>
		         <ul><li>Provide reasoning as to why certain collective agreements and/or wage schedules withing those agreements were or were not used</li></ul>
		

		        <li>The eligible collective agreement that was used was not expired</li>
		      <ul><li>If it was expired, and has not yet been replaced with an updated agreement (e.g. negotiations are ongoing), the amounts of wages and benefits stipulated in the agreement must be adjusted by the average Consumer Price Index for each calendar year that begins after the expiration</li></ul> 
		 
		       <li>The efforts made to ensure sub contractors were aware of the labour requirements</li>
		      <li>The efforts made to ensure sub contractors conveyed the labour requirements to any sub-sub contractors</li>


		      
		             <li>The project labour agreement that covers the work associated with the investments eligible for the specified tax credits was signed </li>
		      <li>How information was communicated to covered workers </li>
		      <li>If projects were under construction prior to November 28, 2023, that a review was made to verify that prevailing wage requirements were met starting from November 28, 2023</li>
	      </ul>

	      </details>
	
	
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>Attesting to prevailing wage requirements</h3>
		<p>Each installation taxation year, you <strong>must</strong> attest that you have met the prevailing wage requirement for covered workers.</p> 	
		
		<p>Refer to: <a href="#compliance">Penalties for non-compliance</a></p>
	</li>

		<p>Generally, the apprenticeship requirements are met by <a href="#effort">making reasonable efforts</a> to ensure that apprentices registered in a <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="Z" href="#Z">Red<span class="nowrap"> Seal trade<span class="mrgn-lft-sm far fa-question-circle"></span></span></a> work at least <strong>10%</strong> of the total hours that are worked during the year by Red Seal workers at a designated work site of the incentive claimant on the preparation or installation of specified property.</p>
<p>This would be subject to the restriction that at no point could there be more apprentices working at the designated work site than are allowed under applicable labour laws or a collective agreement that applies to the work being performed.</p>

		   <summary>Factors to consider for apprenticeship requirements</summary>
		   <p>The following list is non-exhaustive, and is only meant to provide general guidance for potential ITC claimants.</p>
	      <p>Consider:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>The calculation made to confirm that at least 10% of the total labour hours worked by workers in the Red Seal trades have been by apprentices registered in a Red Seal trade at a designated work site</li>
		      <li>The <a href="#effort">reasonable efforts</a> made to ensure the minimum target of 10% was achieved </li>
		      <li>If projects were under construction prior to November 28, 2023, that a review was made to verify that apprenticeship requirements were met starting from November 28, 2023 </li>
	      </ul>

 <summary id="effort">Make reasonable efforts</summary>
	      <p>For the purposes of apprenticeship requirements, in respect of labour performed by apprentices registered in a Red Seal trade, you will be deemed to have made the reasonable efforts if certain conditions are met.</p>
		      <p>These include that you attest in prescribed form that you have complied with the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Review and duly consider all applicants received in response to the advertisement for apprenticeship opportunities that are offered directly by you, and take reasonable steps to ensure that other applicants are reviewed and duly considered</li>
<li>At least every 4 months, you:</li>
<ul><li>Post a bona fide job advertisement, seeking sufficient apprentices to perform those hours of labour. The advertisement must include a commitment to facilitate participation of apprentices in a Red Seal trade program and statement that the job opportunity is open to both existing employees and new hires. This job advertisement must open and readily accessible on the Job Bank website of the Government of Canada and at least 2 other websites either on a continuous basis throughout the year or for at least 30 days from the time of posting.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Communicate with a trade union and at least one secondary school or post-secondary educational institution, for the purpose of facilitating the hiring of the apprentice positions described in the job advertisement</li></ul>
<ul><li>Receive a confirmation in writing from the trade union that the trade union has provided as many apprentices as reasonably possible for work at the designated work site during the installation year, unless the trade union fails to respond within 5 business days of a request</li></ul>
	
</ul>

		 <p>Each installation taxation year, you <strong>must</strong> attest in prescribed form and manner that you have:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Made reasonable efforts to ensure that at least 10% of the total labour hours worked by workers in the Red Seals trade have been by the apprentices registered in a Red Seal trade</li>

        <p>There are consequences for not complying with the labour requirements if you have attested and elected to meet the labour requirements, and claimed the credit at the regular rate. </p>

<h3>Penalty for prevailing wages not compensated</h3>

<p>You will be liable to pay $20 per day for each day in the installation taxation year, for each covered worker that was not paid the prevailing wage, except when <a href="#gross">gross negligence</a> applies.</p>

	      <h3>Penalty for apprenticeship hours not met</h3>
	      <p>You will be liable to pay $50 multiplied by the difference between the total hours of labour that were required to be performed by apprentices of Red Seal trades, and the total hours of labour that were actually performed by apprentices of Red Seal trades.</p>
	      
	   
	      <details>
		      <summary>If you are a partnership</summary>

	    <p>Where no election has been made, the portion of the relevant tax or penalty liability that can reasonably be considered to be each member’s share is payable by each member.</p>

<h3 id="gross">Gross negligence penalty</h3>
	      
<p>Where failure to meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements is intentional or in circumstances amounting in gross negligence, you will be:</p>
	      <ul>
		      <li>Disentitled to the regular tax credit rate and entitled only to the reduced tax credit rate </li>
		        <li>Liable to pay a penalty equal to 50% of the difference between the amount of the clean economy ITC claimed and the amount that you would have been entitled to under the reduced rate</li>
